This is just a simple application for removing usless white space from Python files generated by wxFormBuilder. Simply drag-drop the file(s) onto the application, and it will remove the whitespace. Creates a back-up of the original as well. This way if we have to go back and edit something and re-generate the code, it won't be a chore doing it manually.
