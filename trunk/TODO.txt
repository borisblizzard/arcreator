TODO NOW :)
*******************************
- changing of locale keyboard identifier does not work anymore and no non-ASCII characters are accepted anymore
- add server names to mbservers.php after the release of v1.40
- add TAB to switch between editboxes?

iOS-only:
- add nicer our-other-games
- willResignActive needs to be tested
- fix bug where sound stops on scene change (possibly because calling of play() while Sound is already playing)

***************************************************
Push notifications
- Push notifications (use http://code.google.com/p/apns-php/)
- example for using push notifications: http://code.google.com/p/apns-php/source/browse/trunk/sample_push.php
- we need to get entrust_root_certification_authority.pem


Security
********
- packet content should contain a timestamp
- packet tampering and repeating can be detected by comparing timestamp with 
  current date, and comparing hash based on packet content which includes the 
  timestamp
- session must not depend only on username; password or a session id should be 
  included in future requests (session id preferable if we don't use SSL)
- we should switch to SSL; Apple's docs should contain tolerable examples of
  establishing HTTPS connection with OpenSSL

Future Features:
****************************************
- RSS notifications
