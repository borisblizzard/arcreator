= MessagePack

== Description

MessagePack is a binary-based efficient object serialization library.
It enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON.
But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.

Simple usage is as follows:

  require 'msgpack'
  msg = [1,2,3].to_msgpack  #=> "\x93\x01\x02\x03"
  MessagePack.unpack(msg)   #=> [1,2,3]

Use MessagePack::Unpacker for streaming deserialization.
