7.  Troubleshooting
*********************************************************************************

WINDOWS PROBLEMS
================

On Windows Vista / Windows 7 make sure you run the game as administrator.


BACKGROUND PROGRAMS
===================

Avoid running other programs in the background, behind
Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project.

Programs that start up automatically can cause Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project
to lose control of the screen, keyboard and possibly cause an unstable PC
environment. It is strongly recommended that you close, or suspend applications
that start up automatically or programs that automatically run other applications
at specified times, before running Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project. These
include, but are not limited to:

        - Windows System Agent
        - Windows Task Scheduler
        - Windows "Disk Cleanup" utilities

Similarly, message boxes and dialog boxes from other programs, or from Windows
itself can cause Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project to lose control of the
screen, keyboard , and possibly cause an unstable PC environment. It is strongly
recommended that you shut down all other applications before running
Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project. These include, but are not limited to:

        - Email programs
        - Calendar, appointment, or contact applications
        - Network or Internet chat programs

Also, connections to/from non-dedicated servers can be disrupted when background
programs or screen-savers launch. It is recommend that you shut down other
applications and run Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project by itself whenever
possible.


POWER MANAGEMENT SUSPEND/SLEEP MODES
====================================

Systems (such as laptops or other portables) that automatically power down into
"sleep" or "suspended" modes can cause Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project to lose
control of the screen, keyboard and possibly cause an unstable PC environment. It
is strongly recommended that you disable these features before running
Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project.


WINDOWS VIRTUAL MEMORY ISSUES 
=============================

If you experience any Virtual Memory issues while running the game, try
increasing the page file size on your hard drive.  Please consult the Microsoft
Windows help pages to determine how to change your virtual memory settings.


FONT ISSUES AND TEXT NOT DISPLAYING
===================================

Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project uses several custom fonts and by default
the installation procedure offers the installation the fonts automatically. If
for any the fonts were not installed or it was decided to skip the installation,
some texts during the game will not appear. The fonts can be installed manually
by copying the files from the Fontfiles directory in the game's installation
directory into the operating system's font folder to install them. On Windows
based operating systems the font folder is usually C:\WINDOWS\Fonts. Fonts that
are already installed on the system do not need to be installed again. If due to
some reason the installed font is corrupted and does not show even if it is
already installed, it is recommended to uninstall said font and reinstall it.


*********************************************************************************
8.  Additional Features
*********************************************************************************

Lexima Legends™ IV - Chaos Project has an integrated system to allow you to use
your own images as menu backgrounds.


HOW TO PUT YOUR OWN PICTURE IN THE MENU'S BACKGROUND
====================================================

Resize your picture to 640x480 and save it as .jpg or .png. Name it custom_back1
and put it into the folder where the game is installed. From now on you can
choose "Custom 1" in the "Menu Mode" Option within the Options Menu. For another
background just do the same, but name it custom_back2. Now you will have another
option called "Custom 2" in the Options menu. There is no limit for custom
backgrounds, you only have to make sure the numbers are going in order. i.e. The
game won't recognize a custom_back7 if there is no custom_back6.

Also, if you have a very bright background, the font will not be very readable.
If you have such a background, don't name it i.e. custom_back3, but custom_black3
and the game will use a black font.

For your own sake don't use backgrounds with very high contrasted colors. Neither
black nor white font will improve readablity of the menu in this case.

Example on correctly named files:

custom_back1.png   custom_black2.jpg   custom_back3.jpg

Only .pngs and .jpgs are supported. This system has even a self protection
against file deletion and supports new files automatically. i.e. You are in the
Options Menu and add a file, it will be recognized as soon as you try to change
the menu mode or re-enter the menu. If you delete a file, it will automatically
reset to "Classic" to prevent a glitch or even crash.
